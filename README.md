AI Model Requirements
Input Format

Shape: (batch_size, 132) - Flattened pose landmarks
Normalization: Hip-centered coordinate system with distance normalization
Landmarks: 33 MediaPipe pose landmarks × 4 coordinates (x, y, z, visibility)

Output Format

Classes: 10 golf swing poses (P1-P10)
Output: Softmax probabilities for each class

Training Data Format
The system expects landmarks normalized using this method:
python# Hip-centered normalization (from pose_classifier.py)
left_hip = landmarks[mp.solutions.pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_HIP.value]
right_hip = landmarks[mp.solutions.pose.PoseLandmark.RIGHT_HIP.value]
center_x = (left_hip.x + right_hip.x) / 2
center_y = (left_hip.y + right_hip.y) / 2
max_distance = max([sqrt((lm.x - center_x)² + (lm.y - center_y)²) for lm in landmarks])

normalized_landmarks = [
    [(landmark.x - center_x) / max_distance,
     (landmark.y - center_y) / max_distance,
     landmark.z / max_distance,
     landmark.visibility] 
    for landmark in landmarks
].flatten()
Performance Optimization
Memory Management

Frame Pooling: Pre-allocated frame buffers reduce garbage collection
Efficient Processing: Frame skipping and interval-based processing
Background Operations: Non-blocking uploads and AI inference

Monitoring

Real-time memory efficiency metrics
Upload success rates and queue monitoring
Performance timing for critical operations

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Camera Not Detected
bash# Check camera connection
vcgencmd get_camera

# Enable camera interface
sudo raspi-config
Model Loading Fails
bash# Check Google Cloud authentication
gcloud auth list

# Verify bucket access
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket-name/

# Check model file exists
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket-name/best_model.keras
High Memory Usage

Reduce FRAME_POOL_SIZE in settings
Increase FRAME_SKIP_INTERVAL for less frequent processing
Lower camera resolution in CAMERA_PREVIEW_SIZE

Upload Failures

Verify internet connection
Check Google Cloud Storage permissions
Monitor upload queue: GET /upload_queue_status

Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
pythonLOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
FLASK_DEBUG = True
System Diagnostics
Use the web interface debug tools:

System Debug: Comprehensive system information
Test Current Pose: Validate AI model with current frame
Memory Stats: Detailed memory usage analysis

Security Considerations

Network Access: System binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 - consider firewall rules
File Permissions: Ensure proper permissions for video and model directories
Cloud Credentials: Secure your Google Cloud service account keys
Local Storage: Videos are temporarily stored locally before upload

Development
Adding New Modules
The modular architecture makes it easy to extend:

Create Module Directory: Follow the pattern of existing modules
Add __init__.py: Export main classes/functions
Import in Main App: Add to app.py imports
Update Configuration: Add settings to config/settings.py

Code Style

Follow PEP 8 python style guidelines
Use type hints where appropriate
Include comprehensive error handling
Add logging for important operations

Testing
bash# Run with debug mode
FLASK_DEBUG=True python app.py

# Use web interface debug tools
# Monitor logs for issues
tail -f /var/log/your-app.log
